# 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline for Discussion Data Analysis

## 📖 Overview
This project implements a complete **machine learning pipeline** for collecting, processing, and analyzing discussion data from online sources.  
It automates the **data collection (web scraping)** process, extracts **relevant discussion links and content**, and finally **trains a machine learning model** to derive insights or predictions from the gathered data.  

The pipeline is designed to be modular, scalable, and reproducible — ideal for experimentation with text analytics, sentiment analysis, or topic modeling.

## 🚀 Features
- **Automated Web Scraping**: Extracts discussion URLs and content using Python-based scraping libraries.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans, tokenizes, and prepares raw text data for model consumption.  
- **Model Training**: Implements machine learning models for classification, clustering, or sentiment analysis.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes model performance tracking using accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, etc.  
- **Extensible Design**: Each module can be independently updated or replaced for future scalability.

## 🧱 Pipeline Workflow

1. **Extract Discussion Links**  
   Run `discussion_links_scraper.ipynb` to gather URLs of relevant discussions from target websites or forums.  
   **Output:** A CSV or JSON file containing all collected discussion links.

2. **Scrape Discussion Data**  
   Use `discussion_scraper.ipynb` to extract titles, comments, authors, timestamps, and other relevant fields.  
   **Output:** Structured dataset ready for preprocessing and analysis.

3. **Train Machine Learning Model**  
   Open `model_training.ipynb` to clean and preprocess the text data, train ML models, and evaluate their performance.  
   **Output:** Trained model and evaluation metrics.
